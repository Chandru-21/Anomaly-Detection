# Anomaly-Detection

Anomaly detection, also called outlier detection, is the identification of unexpected events, observations, or items that differ significantly from the norm.Anomalous data can indicate critical incidents, such as a technical glitch etc..

Here I have used Machine Learning to progressively identify and automate anomaly detection.

PS-Most graphs are plotted using plotly library so they won't render in github.So,view the notebook in google colab.
